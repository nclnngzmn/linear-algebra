In using the .sort() function beside the name of the list, it allows to sort the list but in accordance of what is in the key, in this case, lambda is used as the key which means that the list will be sorted by number, beside the lambda is x:x[1], in which x would be a variable for the number (the level in the tuple), and x[1], corresponds to the position of the level, reverse=True is also in the parameter, which indicates of sorting descendingly. A variable picks is created where the names of the pokemons will be stored and reserves[:3] means that, upon sorting descendingly, only 3 pokemons will be stored in variable picks."
